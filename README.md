Raspberry Pi IR-Controlled Internet Radio

For this project, you need the following:

* Raspberry Pi with network connection (ethernet/wireless usb), power supply, SD card etc
* SSD1306 OLED display (eg from Adafruit)
* MCP3008 Analogue to Digital converter chip
* Sharp Infrared distance sensor (such as GP2Y0A02YK0F)

The following are optional:
* USB sound card
* Laser diode

The idea of this project is to create a wireless internet radio which can be controlled exclusively by hand gestures (like a Theremin). The project is in the early stages of development but so far looks promising!
